# WestNileProject
This repository includes code for the collaborative Central Oregon West Nile Monitoring Project for 2017 and 2018, and code to clean downloaded eBird data.

The collaborative monitoring project between Bureau of Land Management, East Cascades Audubon Society, Oregon Department of Fish and Wildlife, Oregon State University Cascades, US Fish and Wildlife Service, and US Forest Service assessed mosquito presence and West Nile virus serostatus in mosquitoes at 16 locations east of Bend, Oregon. Additionally, we evaluated greater sage-grouse use at man-made water features in a water-limited landscape using trail cameras. The code includes methods to import, and visualize trail camera data using the R package camtrapR (https://jniedballa.github.io/camtrapR/).

eBird data (https://ebird.org/science/download-ebird-data-products) include all species in Oregon between January 1995 and July 2020. Data import, cleaning, and visualization accomplished using the R package Auk (https://cornelllabofornithology.github.io/auk/).
